1. efood_case_study.ipynb : This is Jupyter file that has the code. This file includes 3 implementations. Thi first one is reported in the PPT file as well. In order for someone to reproduce the code, he/she needs to enter the direction of the csv file with the initial dataset (df = pd.read_csv('your_efood_dataset.csv')). Thi first case study is implemented with KMeans and is conducting segmentation based on frequency and monetary values, as mentioned in the discription. The second implementation includes segmentation based on quantiles and the third is a RFM (recency frequency monetary) KMeans segmentation. However, since the available data were for only one month and the description of the case study was mentioning to consider frequency and monetary values, this implementation was not considered as final.
